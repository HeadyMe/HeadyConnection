# CodeQL configuration for the HeadySystems repository
#
# This configuration customizes GitHub’s CodeQL code scanning for the
# HeadySystems project.  It augments the default CodeQL queries with the
# `security-extended` suite and limits analysis to the project’s custom
# source code.  By using the `paths` and `paths-ignore` settings, we
# restrict scanning to relevant directories and exclude vendor and
# third‑party code.  The GitHub Docs recommend using `paths` and
# `paths-ignore` to focus analysis on specific directories and to
# exclude files such as `node_modules` or test files【322518979207521†L1480-L1494】.  This helps
# CodeQL complete faster and reduces false positives.  See also the
# example configuration that adds custom query packs and path filters
#【322518979207521†L1546-L1568】.

# Enable additional security queries on top of the default suite.  The
# `security-extended` pack runs extra checks for known vulnerability
# patterns across supported languages.  You can add more packs or
# individual queries under this list, including in‑repository query
# packs or external ones【322518979207521†L1546-L1563】.
queries:
  - uses: security-extended
  - uses: security-and-quality

# Restrict analysis to the custom source code for this project.  CodeQL
# will only analyze files within these directories.  Adjust these
# paths to match the locations of your custom modules or services.
paths:
  - heady_demo_kit/
  - HeadySystems/
  - execute_build.py

# Exclude third‑party and generated code from analysis.  The following
# patterns ignore vendor packages, Node.js dependencies, compiled 
# assets and minified files.  This ensures CodeQL focuses on custom 
# code and reduces noise in the results.
paths-ignore:
  - '**/node_modules/**'
  - '**/vendor/**'
  - '**/dist/**'
  - '**/*.min.js'
  - '**/__pycache__/**'
  - '**/*.pyc'

# Note:
# - Languages to analyze are configured in the CodeQL Action workflow
#   (via the `languages` matrix).  The supported language identifiers
#   include `javascript-typescript`, `python`, `java-kotlin`, and others【322518979207521†L798-L808】.  Ensure
#   the workflow lists the languages present in this repository.
# - To further tune which alerts cause pull request checks to fail,
#   consider using `query-filters` or custom packs as shown in the
#   CodeQL docs【322518979207521†L1546-L1568】.
