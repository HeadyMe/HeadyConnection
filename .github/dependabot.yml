# Dependabot configuration file
#
# This file instructs GitHub's Dependabot to monitor multiple
# package ecosystems for outdated dependencies and automatically
# raise pull requests when updates are available.

version: 2

updates:
  # Keep GitHub Actions workflows up-to-date.  Dependabot scans
  # action versions declared in files under `.github/workflows` and
  # opens a pull request to bump them.  A weekly schedule is
  # sufficient for most projects.
  - package-ecosystem: "github-actions"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"

  # Update Docker base images defined in `Dockerfile` files.  Weekly
  # checks help keep container images secure without overwhelming
  # maintainers.
  - package-ecosystem: "docker"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"

  # Update Node.js dependencies if package.json files exist.
  # Commented out as this repository doesn't currently have npm dependencies.
  # - package-ecosystem: "npm"
  #   directory: "/"
  #   schedule:
  #     interval: "weekly"
  #   open-pull-requests-limit: 10

  # Update Composer dependencies if composer.json files exist.
  # Commented out as this repository doesn't currently have Composer dependencies.
  # - package-ecosystem: "composer"
  #   directory: "/"
  #   schedule:
  #     interval: "weekly"

  # Update Python dependencies.  Many repositories include
  # documentation tooling (e.g. `mkdocs` or Sphinx) or scripts that
  # rely on Python.  Dependabot will inspect `requirements.txt`,
  # `pyproject.toml`, and similar manifests at the root of the
  # repository and propose weekly updates.
  - package-ecosystem: "pip"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"

# Notes:
# - If your manifest files live in different subdirectories, adjust
#   the `directory` paths accordingly.  Dependabot will only scan
#   directories explicitly listed in this file.
# - You can add additional ecosystems (e.g., "maven" for Java or
#   "gomod" for Go) by adding more entries under `updates`.
# - To group multiple dependencies into fewer pull requests, you can
#   define update groups.  See the GitHub Docs for examples of
#   grouping rules and other advanced options.
