# Dependabot configuration file
#
# This file instructs GitHub’s Dependabot to monitor multiple
# package ecosystems for outdated dependencies and automatically
# raise pull requests when updates are available.  The sample
# configuration below is based on GitHub’s documentation, which
# shows how to configure npm, Docker, and GitHub Actions with
# minimal settings【388271434313053†L594-L642】.  Additional entries
# have been added to cover Composer (for PHP/Drupal dependencies)
# and pip (for Python tooling) to reflect the typical structure of
# this project.

version: 2

updates:
  # Keep GitHub Actions workflows up‑to‑date.  Dependabot scans
  # action versions declared in files under `.github/workflows` and
  # opens a pull request to bump them.  A weekly schedule is
  # sufficient for most projects【388271434313053†L615-L652】.
  - package-ecosystem: "github-actions"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"

  # Update Docker base images defined in `Dockerfile` files.  Weekly
  # checks help keep container images secure without overwhelming
  # maintainers【388271434313053†L607-L642】.
  - package-ecosystem: "docker"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"

  # Update Node.js dependencies for the MCP Gateway service.  The
  # `ai/mcp-gateway` directory contains a package.json and lock file
  # defining this microservice’s dependencies.  A weekly cadence
  # balances getting improvements promptly with limiting pull
  # request churn.  You can adjust the `open-pull-requests-limit` to
  # control how many simultaneous PRs Dependabot opens.
  - package-ecosystem: "npm"
    directory: "/ai/mcp-gateway"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
    open-pull-requests-limit: 10

  # Update Composer dependencies for the Drupal application in the
  # `web` directory.  Composer manages PHP packages (including
  # Drupal core and modules), and weekly updates ensure security
  # patches are applied in a timely manner.
  - package-ecosystem: "composer"
    directory: "/web"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"

  # Update Python dependencies.  Many repositories include
  # documentation tooling (e.g. `mkdocs` or Sphinx) or scripts that
  # rely on Python.  Dependabot will inspect `requirements.txt`,
  # `pyproject.toml`, and similar manifests at the root of the
  # repository and propose weekly updates.
  - package-ecosystem: "pip"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"

# Notes:
# - If your manifest files live in different subdirectories, adjust
#   the `directory` paths accordingly.  Dependabot will only scan
#   directories explicitly listed in this file.
# - You can add additional ecosystems (e.g., "maven" for Java or
#   "gomod" for Go) by adding more entries under `updates`.
# - To group multiple dependencies into fewer pull requests, you can
#   define update groups.  See the GitHub Docs for examples of
#   grouping rules and other advanced options【388271434313053†L584-L642】.
