# IDF-20260402-14: HeadyLens Interactive Body Logic Map

## Problem
Complex system architectures are difficult to communicate without exposing sensitive data or overwhelming users with technical jargon. Existing diagrams are static and fail to map system logic to intuitive, human-readable representations.

## Prior Approaches (High Level)
- Static architecture diagrams that lack interactive context.
- Monitoring dashboards that expose raw telemetry without narrative or IP framing.

## Inventive Concept
A HeadyLens interactive body model that maps system logic to anatomically inspired regions, revealing governance and IP context through controlled overlays. The system uses ray-casting to select body parts, applies assignment-aware IP summaries, and renders a HUD layer that keeps the user focused on trust-layer concepts.

## Key Differentiators
- Anatomically inspired mapping to explain system logic without exposing raw telemetry.
- Assignment-aware IP overlays that clarify patent ownership within the UI.
- Modular interaction layers (model loader, raycast handler, overlay renderer, data store).

## Technical Details
- 3D body mesh with named subcomponents for key logic nodes.
- Ray-casting interaction to highlight and zoom to selected regions.
- JSON-backed data store with logic summaries and patent assignments.
- HUD overlay with ARIA and keyboard navigation for accessibility.

## Alternative Embodiments
- Use of high-fidelity anatomical meshes with segmented organ models.
- AR/VR deployment where overlays float above body regions.

## Benefits
- Clarifies complex system trust logic for non-technical stakeholders.
- Enables patent-aware storytelling without exposing sensitive infrastructure.
- Improves investor and compliance communication through verifiable mappings.

## Potential Claim Themes
- Interactive anatomical mapping of system logic with IP overlays.
- Assignment-aware UI overlays tied to patent metadata.
