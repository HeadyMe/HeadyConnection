# Dual-Token Model (Compliance-First Overview)

## Purpose
Heady uses a dual-token structure to clearly separate **utility access** from **equity ownership**. This model is designed to keep compliant boundaries between a consumer-facing token and regulated securities that represent equity interests.

## Token A: HeadyCoin (Utility Token)
**HeadyCoin** is intended exclusively for utility within the Heady ecosystem.

**Intended uses**
- Accessing platform features and services.
- Paying for eligible, non-regulated digital services.
- Participating in platform incentives and rewards.

**Restrictions**
- HeadyCoin does **not** represent equity, ownership, or profit rights.
- HeadyCoin does **not** provide governance rights over corporate entities unless explicitly permitted and compliant.
- HeadyCoin is **not** marketed as an investment or security.

## Token B: HeadySystems Equity (Security Token)
**HeadySystems Equity** represents a regulated security and is treated as a tokenized equity instrument.

**Intended uses**
- Representing ownership interests in Heady Systems (or the applicable issuer).
- Potential eligibility for dividends or distributions as permitted by law and governing documents.

**Restrictions**
- Access limited to eligible and verified participants (e.g., accredited investors where required).
- Subject to securities laws, transfer restrictions, lockups, and jurisdictional compliance.
- Issuance and trading must occur through compliant channels and approved offerings.

## Strict Separation & Compliance Boundary
- Utility and security functions are **deliberately separated** to avoid commingling of rights, marketing claims, and investor expectations.
- Any cross-promotion between tokens must be compliant and reviewed by legal counsel.
- Technical systems should enforce scope boundaries (access control, custody separation, KYC/AML gating).

## Marketing & Communications Guidance
- Messaging must avoid suggesting investment intent for HeadyCoin.
- Equity token communications must include appropriate disclosures and eligibility requirements.
- Any public statements should be reviewed under legal and compliance guidance.
