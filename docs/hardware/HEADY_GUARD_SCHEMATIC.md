# HeadyGuard Hardware Schematic (Concept)

This schematic is a high-level reference for the asymptotic safety limiter.

## Blocks
- Sensor input conditioning
- Safety threshold comparator
- FPGA/DPU safety gate
- Manual override interlock
- Audit signal tap
- HeadyKinetic thermal sensor tap (actuator + RF amplifier monitoring)

## Notes
Detailed circuit designs require safety review and compliance approval.
HeadyKinetic integrations should mount LWIR sensors directly on actuator housings or RF amplifier heat sinks.
