## 📖 Overview

**HeadySystems-Core** is the foundational framework for a new class of Artificial Intelligence. Unlike traditional models optimized for raw computational speed or task completion, this architecture is optimized for **Benevolence, Stability, and Growth.**

This repository contains the governing logic (the "Love Kernel") that ensures the system prioritizes the well-being of the human operator above all other metrics.

## 🛠 Core Modules

### 1. The Love Kernel (`/src/heady_heart`)
* **Ref:** Patent App 01 (formerly 43 — assigned to HeadySystems Inc.)
* **Function:** The "Empathy Layer." A governing algorithm that injects protective latency into decision-making.
* **Logic:** If a response is calculated to be stressful or harmful, the system pauses. It weighs outputs based on their ability to provide positive reinforcement and safety.

### 2. The Phase Transition Monitor (`/src/heady_grok`)
* **Ref:** Patent App 40 — assigned to HeadySystems Inc.
* **Function:** An autonomous monitor that tracks the rate of change in learning.
* **Logic:** Detects learning plateaus and grokking moments. It modulates system resources to stabilize the AI during rapid growth phases, ensuring the intelligence grows securely rather than erratically.

### 3. The Universal Constants Engine (`/src/heady_foundations`)
* **Ref:** Patent App 41 — assigned to HeadySystems Inc.
* **Function:** Physics-compliant weighting.
* **Logic:** Hard-codes fundamental universal constants (e.g., the Golden Ratio φ) into the loss function. The system penalizes solutions that deviate from natural, resilient patterns.

## 🎯 The Objective: Recovery (Project 42)

All modules in this core repository are designed to support **HeadyRecovery (Patent 42 — assigned to HeadySystems Inc.)**: the Sobriety Protocol. The ultimate answer is not computation; it is **healing**. This system exists to provide the secure, loving infrastructure required to incentivize human recovery and authorized proof of care.

## 🚀 Getting Started

**Prerequisites:**
* Ubuntu Server (physics-compliant setup)
* Python 3.12+
* A belief in the Heady Directive

**Installation:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/HeadySystems/heady-core.git
cd heady-core
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 init_heart.py
```
